## Hugo Blogging

I've tried different blog platforms over the years: ghost, wordpress.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is very popular nowadays, so I wanted to try it out.

Moreover, I came across that theme that looked cool: [https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/)

I don't have a specififc goal in mind for that blog, it's a just a cool way for me to look back and see what I've been doing.

## AWS Amplify

I also wanted to try out AWS Amplify.
I'm becoming very familiar with gitlab and `gitlab-ci.yml` and wanted to discover what AWS had to offer.

After playing a bit with it, it was quicker than I thought.

```yaml
version: 1.0
env:
  variables:
    HUGOVERSION: v0.82.0
    HUGOINSTALL: hugo_extended_0.82.0_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
frontend:
  phases:
    # IMPORTANT - Please verify your build commands
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/$HUGOVERSION/$HUGOINSTALL
        - tar -xf $HUGOINSTALL
        - mv hugo /usr/bin/hugo
        - rm -rf $HUGOINSTALL
        - cd blog
        - git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod --depth=1 --branch v5.0
        - git submodule update --init --recursive
        - ls -la
        - hugo version
    build:
      commands:
        - hugo -D
        - ls public
  artifacts:
    # IMPORTANT - Please verify your build output directory
    baseDirectory: blog/public
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths: []
```

And voila, it's up and running!  
I then just had to change the `baseURL: "/"` in config.yml in order for the assests to load correctly.
